## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Textual Clustering Analysis project seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them to us as soon as possible. Your help in disclosing potential vulnerabilities is greatly appreciated, and it allows us to address them promptly and ensure the security of our users.

To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been resolved.

2. Send an email to [eng.gabrielscardoso@gmail.com](mailto:eng.gabrielscardoso@gmail.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability. Include the following information:

   - A brief summary of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any related technical details that could aid in understanding and resolving the issue.

3. Our security team will acknowledge the receipt of your report and work with you to assess and validate the vulnerability.

4. Once the vulnerability has been confirmed, we will initiate the necessary steps to address and resolve the issue.

5. We will keep you informed of the progress and let you know when the vulnerability has been resolved.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the Textual Clustering Analysis project. It encompasses the project's source code, documentation, and official releases. Third-party libraries or dependencies used by the project are subject to their own security policies and should be reported to their respective maintainers.

## Expectations

- Report vulnerabilities in a responsible and coordinated manner, allowing us adequate time to address the issue before any public disclosure.

- Do not exploit any vulnerabilities you discover or attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.

- Provide sufficient details and information to help us understand and reproduce the vulnerability, allowing us to investigate and resolve the issue effectively.

## Reward

We are grateful for your efforts in helping us maintain a secure project. While we do not currently offer a formal bug bounty program, we may, at our discretion, provide acknowledgments and give credit to individuals who report valid security vulnerabilities.

We value the security and privacy of our users, and we appreciate your assistance in making the Textual Clustering Analysis project more secure. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this security policy or need further assistance, please contact our security team at [eng.gabrielscardoso@gmail.com](mailto:eng.gabrielscardoso@gmail.com).

Thank you for helping us ensure the security of the project!
